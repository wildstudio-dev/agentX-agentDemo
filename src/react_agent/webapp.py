- Placeholder text in brackets like [Your Name], [Agent Name], etc.
- Email signatures or closings

This is an SMS text message. End the message naturally after conveying the information.

Example:
Hey Mike, please connect with John about a property. These are the rough numbers â€” Price $500k, Down 20%, Loan $300k, Monthly Payment $2,937. They're ready to talk rates.

Now, write the message using the details below:
- Buyer(s): {buyers}
- Loan Officer(s): {loan_officers}
- Price: {price}
- Down Payment: {down_payment}
- Loan Amount: {loan_amount}
- Monthly Payment: {monthly_payment}"""
