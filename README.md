# LangGraph ReAct Agent Template

This template showcases a [ReAct agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) implemented using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), designed for [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio). ReAct agents are uncomplicated, prototypical agents that can be flexibly extended to many tools.

The core logic, defined in `src/react_agent/graph.py`, demonstrates a flexible ReAct agent that iteratively reasons about user queries and executes actions, showcasing the power of this approach for complex problem-solving tasks.

## What it does

The ReAct agent:

1. Takes a user **query** as input
2. Reasons about the query and decides on an action
3. Executes the chosen action using available tools
4. Observes the result of the action
5. Repeats steps 2-4 until it can provide a final answer

By default, it's set up with a basic set of tools, but can be easily extended with custom tools to suit various use cases.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have already [installed LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#download), to set up:

Make sure you install uv https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
and make. So you can use the Make file and do make dev to run in development.

1. Create a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Define required API keys in your `.env` file.

### Setup Model

The defaults values for `model` are shown below:

```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
```

Follow the instructions below to get set up, or pick one of the additional options.

#### Anthropic

To use Anthropic's chat models:

1. Sign up for an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Once you have your API key, add it to your `.env` file:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
#### OpenAI

To use OpenAI's chat models:

1. Sign up for an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. Once you have your API key, add it to your `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Setup memory

Make sure you have the OPENAI_TOKEN or relevant embeddings model token.

We specify in langgraph.json a embeddings functions since the standard approach
with default embedding strategy fails.

End setup instructions

3. Customize whatever you'd like in the code.
4. Open the folder LangGraph Studio!

## Security
https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/auth/add_auth_server/#3-implement-token-validation
/security/auth.py keep the token validation logic for the agent. This is used to validate the token passed in the request header.
langgraph.json has the auth server file configured, so you can use the auth file to validate the token.
We can use add_owner to set default filters for that user and as well we can use the user_id to filter
when needed during process time.

## How to customize

1. **Add new tools**: Extend the agent's capabilities by adding new tools in [tools.py](./src/react_agent/tools.py). These can be any Python functions that perform specific tasks.
2. **Select a different model**: We default to Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet. You can select a compatible chat model using `provider/model-name` via configuration. Example: `openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview`.
3. **Customize the prompt**: We provide a default system prompt in [prompts.py](./src/react_agent/prompts.py). You can easily update this via configuration in the studio.

You can also quickly extend this template by:

- Modifying the agent's reasoning process in [graph.py](./src/react_agent/graph.py).
- Adjusting the ReAct loop or adding additional steps to the agent's decision-making process.

## Development

While iterating on your graph, you can edit past state and rerun your app from past states to debug specific nodes. Local changes will be automatically applied via hot reload. Try adding an interrupt before the agent calls tools, updating the default system message in `src/react_agent/configuration.py` to take on a persona, or adding additional nodes and edges!

Follow up requests will be appended to the same thread. You can create an entirely new thread, clearing previous history, using the `+` button in the top right.

You can find the latest (under construction) docs on [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) here, including examples and other references. Using those guides can help you pick the right patterns to adapt here for your use case.

LangGraph Studio also integrates with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for more in-depth tracing and collaboration with teammates.
