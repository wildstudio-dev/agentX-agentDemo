Mortgage Rate Calculation Tool V2
1 – Thinking we should emphasize payment more than rate. So much so, I would actually put
the interest rate in the below section.
2 – Let’s add a disclaimer regarding the rate (to keep Real Estate Agents from getting in trouble
with a Federal or State regulator, in the event the regulator thinks they are acting as a loan
officer)
Disclaimer:
This rate and payment estimate is generated using AI and is intended for illustrative purposes
only. It does not constitute a loan offer, pre-qualification, or commitment to lend.
The estimated rate is based on the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey®
(PMMS®) average for the applicable loan type during the week of the request, plus an
assumed margin of 0.50%. Actual rates and terms may vary based on a variety of factors,
including credit profile, property type, loan amount, down payment, and market conditions.
All borrowers must complete a full loan application and receive official loan disclosures before
relying on any figures for decision-making. Please contact a licensed loan officer for a
personalized quote and full details.
3 – The standard type of question that will be asked to the AgentX assistant is going to be
something like : “What’s the payment on a $950,000 purchase with 20,000 down?”
, or “What’s
the payment on a 625000, with 5% down?”
,
“What’s the payment on a 760,000 purchase at a 75
loan to value, LTV?”
4 – On the Assumptions, I think it would be warranted to put a couple more :
Purchase Price = X
Down Payment = X
Loan Amount = X
This keeps them from hitting their calculator to figure out one of the three options.
Maybe add loan to value (LTV).
= loan amount/purchase price
5 – Another thing that agents would do is to say, ? what if the rate is 6.5%. I feel this would be
quite common, as they like to think they are mortgage officers., and should be able to calculate
the payment. It is interesting on the Simple Nexus APP that I have given agents, most of the
time they are using the APP to calculate the payment on something they are going to purchase
themselves and know they will get a great rate when they go through Intercap.
6 – Loan Type – This gets a little tricky, as there are the following loan types –
Conforming/Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, Jumbo, Why is this tricky, because there is a lot of
involved with the different options. I will list some general ideas below to think about, or perhaps,
we just only quote conventional, 80% loan to value. You can decide.
7- Default Rate – Our team thinks we should reference the Freddie Macs site for a generic rate
and add 0.5% to it. Not a bad idea, as the agent just wants to get close. Allowing them to direct
AI to change the rate would give them the ability to custom tailor an option.
The Freddie mac rate site is here : https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms
Conventional/Conforming
Every County has a Conforming loan limit. This means that every county has a maximum loan
amount that a borrower may be eligible for. A great place to look up a county loan limit is here :
https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/hicostlook.cfm - note, you need to select a state, and then on
the drop down, select Fannie/Freddie – FHA loan limits are here as well.
or you can review the spreadsheet attached. If this is something you feel is worth incorporating,
I would get with Ashish, as his team have built a great tool for this.
Conforming loans have MI with loan to values greater than 80%. I am guessing you are
receiving this value from OB, with the given parameter. Probably not a bad add on, but let’s use
the payment based off of the Freddie Mac Rate + 0.5% and if you want to show MI, import that
in as well from OB.
For Conforming loans, the Monthly MI is calculated with a simple formula : (MI Factor \* Loan
Amount )/ 12, for example, if the loan amount was 100,000, and due to FHA calculating this
from some archaic ideology that stemmed from the only person at HUD that had a math degree
in the 1980’s, who thought he should show off his ability in series expansions for the calculation
of the monthly FHA MI.
FHA
So, if someone asked for a FHA loan, 99% of the time, the down payment would be 3.5%,
however, the final loan amount is calculated a little bit differently.
Final Loan Amount = Base Loan Amount (96.5% LTV) \* 1.75% + Base Loan Amount.
For example, if the purchase price was 100,000, the base loan amount would be 96,500.
The final loan amount (or the loan amount the payment should be calculated on is ) 96,500\*
1.75% + 96,500 = 98,188.75
Also, I believe you are pulling the MI on FHA from OB for a given loan amount (you need to
pass the total loan amount to OB), the MI rate for FHA loans is 0.55% generally, however, the
calculation of the monthly MI is some series addition integral. If you google this, FHA wrote a
doc in the late 80’s on how you are supposed to calculate it.
I like displaying the Total Loan Amount that the payment is based off of in the assumptions
VA
Generally if someone says a VA loan, the loan to value is 100%, so if an agent said, what’s the
payment on an 800,000, purchase price on a VA loan, the payment would be based off of the
purchase price plus a funding fee. The funding fee is between 0%-3.3% of the loan amount, and
added to the loan.
Here is the funding fee table.
https://www.benefits.va.gov/stpaul/images/FundingFeeCard.pdf
For example,
“what is the payment on a VA purchase with a price of $100,000”
, I think the
answer is based off of a payment of 103,300 (loan amount plus a 3.3%fuding), maybe the user
can say something like the veteran is exempt (no funding fee), or the funding fee is X%
Again, it starts to get tricky
Jumbo
I would treat jumbo just like conventional, however, I would not include the overlay of MI
USDA – Honestly, I would not even go down this path.
Some other assumptions I think are relenvent are :
Occupancy – Primary (not property type)
Units – 1
Credit Score – 760 (no dollar)
Property Taxes – You mentioned a preference section, which I loved. The agent should be able
to adjust their preference for property tax. Each county/state has a different way to calculate it,
so having them enter the default is not a bad idea. Regardless, the tax rate should show next to
the property tax monthly amount, for instance 0.55%
I would also include the annual tax amount. Additionally, I foresee the agent stating,
property taxes are $3,600, please tell me the payment”
“well, the
Taxes ($3,600 annually) - $300 per month
Insurance – I would put both annual and monthly
Property Type – Single Family
Also, regarding the onboarding of some real estate agents. I would like to be looped in with
anyone you want to onboard, and would also like to loop you in with anyone that I think is
warranted. It would be nice to discuss why they need to sign an NDA (Angie has put together a
great one), as I feel this is very relevant. I would also like to get in the discussion loop with
regards to their questions, or prompts on payments. This will be a great feedback loop we can
close when they start using the product. Ultimately, they should be getting close to quoting a
payment, but more importantly, should be pushing the question to a loan officer that is going to
do the deal. This again strengthens the Pyramid (RE Agent – Loan Officer – Buyer), The
pyramid idea of data exchange is going to be epic.
Excited to move forward
